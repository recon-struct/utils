This is a repository of utility functions for TypeScript and JavaScript.

## 🤨 Why?

Many of these functions leverage the
[@recon-struct/utility-types](https://github.com/recon-struct/utility-types)
library which enables ismorphic functions in which the return value of a
function can be inspected prior to compilation. Use of these functions
supercharge AI based tools like [Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot).
